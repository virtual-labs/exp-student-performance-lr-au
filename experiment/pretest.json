      "question": "In the simple linear regression model Y = β0 + β1X + ε, what does the slope (β1) represent?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The predicted exam score",
        "b": "The average exam score of all students",
        "c": "The average increase in exam score for each additional hour studied",
        "d": "The random error added to the prediction"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This refers to Y, not the slope.",
        "b": "The average score is computed from data, not represented by β1.",
        "c": "Correct! β1 represents how much the exam score changes for every additional hour studied.",
        "d": "ε represents the random error, not β1."

      "question": "What does the intercept (β0) indicate in the linear regression equation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The exam score when study hours are zero",
        "b": "The variance of exam scores",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! β0 represents the expected score when X = 0.",
        "b": "Variance is unrelated to the intercept.",
        "c": "Correlation is not represented by β0.",
        "d": "The error term is ε, not β0."

      "question": "Which metric is used to measure the average squared error between predicted and actual exam scores?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Standard deviation",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Standard deviation measures spread, not prediction error.",
        "b": "RMSE is the square root of MSE, not the MSE itself.",
        "c": "Correct! MSE measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.",

      "question": "Why do we split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To visualize the scatter plot more clearly",
        "b": "To check how well the model performs on unseen data",

        "d": "To increase the size of the dataset artificially"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Visualization is not the reason for splitting data.",
        "b": "Correct! Testing data helps evaluate model generalization.",
        "c": "Outlier removal is part of preprocessing, not dataset splitting.",

      "question": "Which assumption must hold true for applying simple linear regression?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "There should be a linear relationship between study hours and exam score",
        "b": "The dataset must contain more than 1000 rows",
        "c": "Study hours must follow a normal distribution",
        "d": "The exam scores must have no variance"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Linear regression requires a linear relationship between X and Y.",
        "b": "There is no such minimum dataset size requirement.",
        "c": "Normality of X is not a strict requirement for simple linear regression.",
        "d": "If scores have no variance, regression cannot be performed."

    {
      "question": "Why is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed before fitting the regression model?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To visually check if a linear trend exists between study hours and exam scores",
        "b": "To automatically compute the regression coefficients β0 and β1",
        "c": "To convert categorical variables into numerical values",
        "d": "To remove the linear relationship from the data"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! EDA helps confirm linearity and understand the data.",
        "b": "Coefficients are computed during model fitting, not EDA.",
        "c": "This is preprocessing, not EDA.",
        "d": "Regression requires a linear relationship; removing it is not useful."
