    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the purpose of linear regression?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To group data points into clusters",
        "b": "To model the linear relationship between a predictor and a response variable",
        "c": "To classify data into categories",
        "d": "To remove noisy data points"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Clustering is an unsupervised learning method, not regression.",
        "b": "Correct! Linear regression estimates how X affects Y using a linear relationship.",
        "c": "Classification predicts categories, not continuous values.",
        "d": "Noise removal is part of preprocessing, not regression."

    {
      "question": "What does a high Mean Squared Error (MSE) tell us about a regression model?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The model’s predictions are far from actual values",
        "b": "The regression line fits the data well",
        "c": "The model has no error",
        "d": "The model has perfect accuracy"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! A high MSE means large differences between predicted and real values.",
        "b": "A good fit would have low MSE.",
        "c": "High MSE means the opposite—high error.",
        "d": "Perfect accuracy is unrealistic and would result in MSE = 0."

    {
      "question": "In the equation Y = β0 + β1X + ε, what does the error term (ε) represent?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The part of Y explained by X",
        "b": "Random variation in Y not captured by the linear model",
        "c": "The slope of the regression line",
        "d": "The predicted value of Y"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The explained part is β0 + β1X.",
        "b": "Correct! ε represents noise or unexplained variation.",
        "c": "β1 is the slope.",
        "d": "Ŷ is the predicted value, not ε."

    {
      "question": "What does the intercept (β0) represent in a simple linear regression model?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The predicted value of Y when X = 0",
        "b": "The slope of the line",
        "c": "The total number of observations",
        "d": "The variability in the dependent variable"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! β0 tells us the expected value of Y when X is 0.",
        "b": "β1 is the slope, not β0.",
        "c": "The number of observations is n, not β0.",
        "d": "Variability is measured by variance or standard deviation."

    },
    {
      "question": "Why do we perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) before fitting the regression model?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To check whether a linear trend exists between study hours and exam scores",
        "b": "To automatically calculate the regression coefficients",
        "c": "To split the dataset into training and testing sets",
        "d": "To remove the need for preprocessing"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! EDA helps visually confirm linearity, an important assumption.",
        "b": "Coefficients are calculated during model fitting.",
        "c": "Dataset splitting is done separately.",
        "d": "EDA does not replace preprocessing."

    {
      "question": "What does a high R-squared (R²) value indicate about a regression model?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The model explains a large portion of the variation in the data",
        "b": "The model has a high error term",
        "c": "The regression line is horizontal",
        "d": "The training data contains no noise"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! High R² means the model explains most of the variability in Y.",
        "b": "High error corresponds to low R².",
        "c": "A horizontal line means no relationship.",
        "d": "Noise can still exist even if R² is high."
