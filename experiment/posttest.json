    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the purpose of linear regression?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To cluster students based on performance",
        "b": "To predict a categorical outcome from continuous data",
        "c": "To estimate the relationship between an independent and a dependent variable ",
        "d": "To remove outliers from a dataset"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique, not regression.",
        "b": "That describes classification; linear regression predicts continuous outcomes.",
        "c": "Correct!Linear regression models the relationship between variables to make predictions.",
        "d": "Removing outliers is a preprocessing step, not the goal of regression."

    {
      "question": "What does a high Mean Squared Error (MSE) value indicate about a regression model?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The model predicts values accurately",
        "b": "The regression line fits the data well",
        "c": "The model has a lot of prediction errors",
        "d": "The model has high R-squared value"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "High MSE means there's a large error between predicted and actual values.",
        "b": "A low MSE would indicate a good fit.",
        "c": "Correct!A high MSE means predictions deviate significantly from actual values.",
        "d": "MSE and R² are related but not directly correlated in that way."

    {
      "question": "What does the error term (ε) represent in the regression equation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The slope of the regression line",
        "b": "The difference between the actual and predicted values ",
        "c": "The total number of students",
        "d": "The final predicted value"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The slope is b, not the error term.",
        "b": "Correct!The error term accounts for the variation in Y not explained by X.",
        "c": "ε has nothing to do with sample size.",
        "d": "The predicted value is represented by Ŷ, not ε."

    {
      "question": "In the regression equation Y = a + bX + ε, what does 'a' represent?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The exam score when study hours are zero",
        "b": "The total number of observations",
        "c": "The predicted score after one hour of study",
        "d": "The error of the model"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The intercept a gives the predicted value of Y when X = 0.",
        "b": "That’s usually represented by n, not a.",
        "c": "That would be a + b(1), not just a.",
        "d": "The error is represented by ε, not a."

    {
      "question": "Why is it important to evaluate a regression model on a testing dataset?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To adjust the training data",
        "b": "To check how well the model performs on unseen data ",
        "c": "To increase the value of R-squared",
        "d": "To perform feature scaling"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Evaluation doesn’t involve modifying training data.",
        "b": "Correct!Testing data helps assess the model’s generalization ability.",
        "c": "R-squared is a result, not something we directly increase during evaluation.",
        "d": "Feature scaling is part of preprocessing, not evaluation."
